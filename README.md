 Basic Fivem Support // Report system
    Very Basic, someone can do /report with a problem, a staff can then do /r ID or /areply to reply to their report with out having to tp the staff can then decide to do /rspec ID to spectate the player and speak on shouting mode for them to hear them.

    Uses EasyAdmins spectate function, which means you need to disable the easyadmin report command in the config.

The script now sends full transcripts to a webhook of their conversation, I know the code is extremly messy but eh, you can change the webhook on line 5 of server.lua I personally think its really cool but you can be the judge of it :)
